		<h1>Real-idle demo</h1>
		<p>A GUI is needed for this lib to function, that's why there's an electron application in here</p>
		<p>The current idle state is polled every 10 seconds and the idle threshold is 30 seconds.</p>
		<p>You can modify this in demo/electron.js</p>
		<p>See the logs in the terminal to follow up with the events!</p>
